# AIFFEL Forked Repositories Hub

## Overview
This repository is for storing and managing forked repositories related to the AIFFEL Core course. 


## Important Note
### Repositories marked with '*' in the name are old versions.
- While managing this repository, there was a change in the way some forked repositories were handled. 
- The repositories marked with '*' are copies of the original forked repositories from the old version. 
- During the subtree merging process of forked repositories, the original forked repositories are deleted
- Consequently, syncing changes with the original repositories is no longer possible.

### Repositories without '*' in the name are the updated versions.
- Please check repositories without '*' in the name.
- These are the updated versions.
- I have re-forked and made necessary updates for improved management.
- Feel free to explore **the updated projects without the '*' mark** for the latest content.
